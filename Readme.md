## uoAvos-Development - `Official Release` <div align="Right">Last Updated: 03/17/2023</div>

>**What Is With The New RunUO Emulator?!**
-   Welcome to uoAvocation, our primary goal is to modify the server emulator ([RunUO](https://github.com/runuo/runuo)) and the custom client ([ClassicUO](http://www.classicuo.eu/)) in an effort to create a [game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine) that gamers can use to develop new genres of games while maintaining the same isometric graphic aspect ratio (1:1) as  [Ultima Online](http://www.uo.com/)™.

>**Who Should Download The Game Engine?**
-   That is entirely decided on a case-by-case basis, and it is really just a matter of preference. If you are an Ultima Online™ fanatic, like most people in the community, then I would recommend you stick with any RunUO_v2.x emulator. RunUO is easier to learn and there is a lot of support out there if you run into issues. Alternatively, you can use ServUO which is very well established and further ahead of RunUO with Ultima Online™ era-specific content.

-   However, if you want a  _fresh start_  at making a game, and you don't mind moving away from Ultima Online™, then uoAvos might be a better choice for you. Whether you want to recreate the medieval landscape and storylines of Ultima Online™ in your own vision, or you want to modify the ClassicUO client to create your own genre of game, uoAvos offers you the type of flexibility where your only limitation is your creativity.

>**What To Expect From Using This Repository?**
-   What everyone should understand is that the uoAvos game engine was designed to be generic; it follows where creativity leads. This project is a foundation to developing a truly custom  [mmo/ mmorpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game)  experience. uoAvos DOES NOT follow the RunUO, ServUO, and ModernUO standard of Ultima Online™ emulation; we have deviated from it.

## uoAvos Features:

![N|Solid](http://www.uoavocation.net/portal/site_image/github/checkmark.png =24x24)**Poly3D Regions and In-Game Region Editor**
- region independent weather.
- create parent and child regions of any shape and size.
- add rules for each region; child regions can adopt their parent region conditions or they can have their own.
- new regions can be added immediately (without server restart).

![N|Solid](http://www.uoavocation.net/portal/site_image/github/checkmark.png =24x24)**Multiple Currency Trading with Vendor Compatibility!**
- regions can have their own independent currency.
- vendors can be assigned to take specific currency.
- regions can be assigned RED, BLUE, or NEUTRAL: this provides safe havens for criminals and murderers. It is also a great way to set up a gladiatorial arena in a much more efficient way (you can set the seating to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_environment">PvE</a> and the center of the arena to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player">PvP</a>). This allows the fight to go on without the spectator(s) becoming mincemeat. 

![N|Solid](http://www.uoavocation.net/portal/site_image/github/checkmark.png =24x24)**Assigned Home Cities and City Loyalty**
- When players initially log in they will be asked to choose a home city; this can be modified for custom facets and custom cities so this system works for everyone with a little tweaking. 
- Home city loyalty can be used as a flag to a condition, or series of conditions, that must be met with other systems and quests added to your servers. This addition has a lot of possibilities for expansion.

![N|Solid](http://www.uoavocation.net/portal/site_image/github/checkmark.png =24x24)**And Many More Expansions To Come...**
- uoAvos will always be a work-in-progress project. That means that as long as we are alive and kicking, we will continue to find ways to improve the game engine to allow users to create game servers that could potentially compete with any pixel-art-oriented isometric games on the market!
